### 00 Basic GitHub

GitHub (or GitLab) is designed to host, track and share computer programs. Each program is stored in a separate repository. The server holds the 'main' or 'master' version of the repository and each local user clones the repository at a given time. Each user is then free to develop the program independently from the version on the remote. Then if a modification is made on the program and should be copied towards the remote 'main' program, the user shall commit its changes, and push them towards the server. The possibility to create branches allows to maintain different copies of the program until each branch is checked for bugs and so on. Branches can be merged.

Each GitHub repository should contain such `README.md` explaining the purpose of the program and its main characteristics.
