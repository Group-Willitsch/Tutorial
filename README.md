# TUTORIAL

This GitHub repository is intended to serve as a tutorial for using GitHub. Also this is a place to store some Python tutorial programs.

### 00 Basic GitHub

GitHub (or GitLab) is designed to host, track and share computer programs. Each program is stored in a separate repository located on a remote server, while each local user clones the repository at a given time and work as desired. Then if a modification is made on the program and should be copied towards the remote 'main' branch of the repository, the user shall commit its changes, and push them towards the server. The commands to do so are
```
commit -m <commit message explaining the change>
push
```
but I recommend using the GitHub Desktop app which is much much more convenient.

The possibility to create branches allows to maintain different copies of the program until each branch is checked for bugs and so on. So when planning a big modification that may break the code, make a branch first and work on this one. Branches can be merged later.

Each GitHub repository should contain such `README.md` explaining the purpose of the program and its main characteristics.
