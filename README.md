# TUTORIAL

This is a tutorial GitHub repository used to teach you the basics of Git and GitHub, then python.

Git is a distributed version control (DVC) system that allows to manage a program and its versions and track the changes made by programmers. GitHub is a proprietary platform that uses git to provide DVC and hosts programs under the form of repositories.

Python is a free and open-source programming language widely used in a very broad range of fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, graphical interface, command control, and much more ! Anything is possible with Python ! Due to its simplicity and readability, its huge active community, Python is ideal to learn programming in general.

## 00 Introduction to GitHub

In this first section we will see what is GitHub, why we use it, and how.

GitHub (or GitLab) is designed to host, track and share computer programs. Each program is stored in a separate repository located on a remote server. A local user clones the repository at a given time and work as desired. Then if a modification is made on the program and should be copied towards the remote 'main' branch of the repository, the user shall commit its changes, and push them towards the server. Everyone will have access to it. The commands to do so are

```
commit -m <commit message explaining the change>
push
```

but I recommend using the GitHub Desktop app which is much much more convenient.

The possibility to create branches allows to maintain different copies of the program until each branch is checked for bugs and so on. So when planning a big modification that may break the code, make a branch first and work on this one. Branches can be merged later.

Each GitHub repository should contain such `README.md` explaining the purpose of the program and its main characteristics.

As a scholar, Github provides an access to its GitHub copilot AI that can be implemented in an editor such as Visual Studio Code (VSC). VSC is a nice editor that I recommend.

## 10 Introduction to Python

In this section we will see what is Python, how to install and use it. The course will be the opportunity to get familiar with Python itself and practice the main features of Python. This is a nice introductory course to any programming.

## 20 Intermediary Python

In this section we will discuss Python functionnalities oriented towards scientific concerns.
